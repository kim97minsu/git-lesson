## Part 1 - Github

### Read all the instructions below before you do anything.  With every lab/homework/project/activity/exercise we give you, ***always*** read through all the instructions before you do start.

0. **Do not fork this repository.**

1. If you cloned this repository, `cd` into the folder that was created by the clone and then skip the rest of this step.  If you did *_not_* clone this repository, create a directory called `git-github-lab` in your directory for today and `cd` into it.  Initialize a git repo. (`git init`). **Do not run `git init` if you are already in a repository that you cloned**. You can check if you're already in a repo by running `git status`.  If it says `fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`, then you are **not in a repo** and it is safe to run git init.  If it says ANYTHING ELSE, then DO **NOT** run `git init`.  You do not ever want to run git init inside of an existing repo.  **No git repos inside of git repos!!!**

2. In the top level of your repository, create a file `github-lab-answers.md` and answer the questions below. Commit your work at each point when directed.

2. Look at the questions below and answer them as you complete this tutorial: <https://try.github.io>

3. This tutorial is also great for learning git: http://gitimmersion.com/ It's fairly long, but don't feel like you need to pick it all up in one sitting—you can come back to it.

## Part 3 - Fake Resume Site

#### Setup your folder and files

1. Inside the `github-lab` directory, create a new directory called `resume_page`.
1. Change directories to `resume_page`. Create two files: `index.html` and `style.css`.<br>
1. Using Sublime, open your files and add the HTML boilerplate code.<br>
1. Create a heading level-one tag with your name.<br>
1. Open the `index.html` in your browser to confirm that everything is set up properly.
Reminder: To open your file with your browser, from the command line, type `open index.html`

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 5 - index.html file is setup".
<hr>

#### Add some content to your site

1. Insert a professional image of yourself or someone else ('img' tag); it should be placed right after your 'h1' tags<br>
1. Insert an unordered list of your last three positions ('ul' tag)<br>
1. Create links to your (or someone's) LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages ('a' tag)<br>1. Use level-three heading tags to create headings before your positions and before your links<br>

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 6 -  Added initial content for resume site".
<hr>


#### Add some style to your site

1. Center your "h1" tag<br>
1. Change the font of your "h1" tag<br>
1. Change the color of the font of your "h3" tag text<br>
1. Add some space on the body of your application to make your site look more appealing.<br>

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 7 -  Added initial styling for resume site".
<hr>


#### Add some navigation to your site

1. Create a nav bar with the links to your LinkedIn, Twitter (whichever links you had created earlier); Remove the links section that you had created earlier in the homework.
1. In the nav bar, also create a link to the 'index.html' page (maybe give it a name of `Home Page` in the bar), and a link to a file called "projects.html" (maybe call this `Projects` in the bar) <br>
1. Create another html file in this folder called 'projects.html'<br>
1. Copy the contents of the nav bar and information from the 'head' tag of your `index.html` file and paste it into your `projects.html` file<br>
1. Inside `projects.html`, create a level-two heading and add the text `Projects`<br>
1. Check to make sure that your links work! When you click on "Projects" in your nav bar, does it open the `projects.html` document?<br>
1. In 'projects.html', add your three most recent projects (or just make some up). To do this simply, you can use an ordered list. If you're up for a little more of a challenge, create three columns: each column should contain the title and a description of your three most recent, successful projects<br>

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 8 -  Added project.html page and content".
<hr>


## Part 4 - Loops
#### Stay Fresh! Looping with Javascript

* In the `github-lab` folder, create a directory called `loop-questions`.  In `loop-questions` directory, create our usual folder structure with the `index.html` that has the `app.js` linked up in a `<script>` tag. After each question, test your code by reloading the browser and checking the console.
1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 0-99, (ascending)
2. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 99-0 (descending)
3. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 298-1, **counting** down by 3 (the code in the loop should run 99 times)
4. Create a loop that logs the **EVEN** numbers from 0-98 (ascending)
5. Create a loop that logs the **ODD** numbers from 98-0 (descending)

8. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 1-91 **that are multiples of 3** (ascending)

&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 9 - Created loops.js file".

## Conclusion

 1. Inside the `git-github-lab` directory, you should now have a file called `github-lab-answers.md`, a directory called `loop-questions`, and a directory called `resume_page` which contains `index.html`, `projects.html`, and `style.css`.

 2. You should have been adding and committing along the way, but please type `git status` one last time to make sure that everything is committed. If it's not, please commit.
